# RemoteDict: A Minimal Redis-like In-Memory Dictionary Server

RemoteDict is a lightweight, in-memory key-value store server implemented in Python. It mimics a subset of the Redis protocol and can be accessed using any Redis client library (such as `redis-py`).

## Features
- RESP protocol support for basic commands: `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `EXISTS`, `KEYS`
- In-memory storage (no persistence) via `RemoteDict`
- Expiring keys (with TTL) via `ExpiringRemoteDict`
- Persistent storage (disk-backed) via `PersistentRemoteDict`
- Asyncio-based server with optional threaded start/stop
- Compatible with Redis clients (e.g., `redis-py`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or copy the relevant files from `src/remotedict/` into your project.
2. Install the required client library:
   
   ```shell
   pip install redis
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic In-Memory Server (`RemoteDict`)
```python
import time
import redis
from remotedict import RemoteDict

# Start the server in a background thread
server = RemoteDict(address="127.0.0.1", port=8085)
server.start_thread()
time.sleep(0.5)  # Give the server a moment to start

# Connect as a client using redis-py
r = redis.Redis(host="127.0.0.1", port=8085, decode_responses=True)

# SET key value
r.set("foo", "bar")

# GET key
print(r.get("foo"))  # Output: bar

server.stop_thread()
```

### Expiring Keys (`ExpiringRemoteDict`)
```python
from remotedict import ExpiringRemoteDict

# All keys will expire after 5 seconds (default expiry for all keys)
server = ExpiringRemoteDict(address="127.0.0.1", port=8086, expiry_seconds=5)
server.start_thread()
# ...
# All keys set will automatically expire after 5 seconds
# ...
server.stop_thread()
```

### Persistent Storage (`PersistentRemoteDict`)
```python
from remotedict import PersistentRemoteDict

server = PersistentRemoteDict(address="127.0.0.1", port=8087, db_path="./mydb.json")
server.start_thread()
# ...
# Data will be saved to disk and reloaded on restart
# ...
server.stop_thread()
```

## Testing
You can run the test suites for all variants using unittest or by running the provided test runner script.

### Run all tests (recommended)
```shell
python -m tests.run_tests
```

### Run individual test suites
```shell
python -m unittest tests/test_remotedict_server.py
python -m unittest tests/test_expiring_remotedict_server.py
python -m unittest tests/test_persistent_remotedict_server.py
```

All tests should pass if the server and its variants are working correctly.

## Supported Commands
- `SET key value` — Set the value for a key
- `GET key` — Get the value for a key
- `DEL key [key ...]` — Delete one or more keys
- `EXISTS key [key ...]` — Check if one or more keys exist
- `KEYS pattern` — List keys matching a pattern (supports Unix shell-style wildcards)
- `FLUSHDB` — Remove all keys from the current database
- `FLUSHALL` — Remove all keys from all databases (if supported)

## Notes
- Expiry in `ExpiringRemoteDict` is global: all keys expire after the configured `expiry_seconds` (default: 3600 seconds). There is no per-key expiry or TTL/EXPIRE command support.
- This server is for educational/testing purposes and is not suitable for production use.
- Data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server stops, except when using `PersistentRemoteDict`.
- Expiry and persistence features are only available in their respective variants.
